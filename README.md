NBA player projection model which aims to predict player statistics (points, rebounds and assists) for the next match using past data.

Issues i'm working on:
    Incorrect projections for injured players and players who just had a poor game

Future updates I'm looking to make:
    Adding team defence ratings against player positions (for example, the Indiana Pacers rank amongst the last in the league in defending against power forwards).
    Adding player fatigue ratings (for example, players who have played 40 minutes in the last game and are on a back to back will have a lower rating).
    Adding player injury ratings (for example, players who are on the injury report will have a lower projection, thanks to a likely minutes restriction).
    Adding player position ratings (for example, players who are playing out of position will have a lower rating).
    Adding team ratings (for example, the team's overall pace, their three point shooting percentage, etc.)
    Adding player ratings (for example, a player's overall pace, their three point shooting percentage, etc.) 

Currently, this model gives a projection for the next game based on the season averages and the 5 game rolling averages. 
Please let me know if you have any potential updates or if it causes any bugs.
